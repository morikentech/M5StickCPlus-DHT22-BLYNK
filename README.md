# M5StickCPlus Temperature and Humidity Display

This project demonstrates how to use an M5StickCPlus and a DHT22 sensor to display temperature and humidity data on the M5StickCPlus screen.

## Hardware Requirements
- M5StickCPlus
- DHT22 sensor
- Jumper wires
- 10kΩ resistor (for pull-up)

## Wiring
- Connect the VCC pin of the DHT22 sensor to the 5V pin of the M5StickCPlus.
- Connect the GND pin of the DHT22 sensor to the GND pin of the M5StickCPlus.
- Connect the DATA pin of the DHT22 sensor to the G26 pin of the M5StickCPlus.
- Add a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between the DATA pin and the VCC pin of the DHT22 sensor.
